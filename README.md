# pstree-simulation
This is a simulation of computer processes using tree data structures. As a bit of background, when the computer boots, it creates a process. That process creates child processes, which in turn create child processes, and so on. In this project, we assume each process can create up to two child processes, giving rise to the binary tree data structure used.
This project was implemented as a CSC190 course project at the University of Toronto in winter 2013. You can learn more about the project goals and requirements [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab5.html) and [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab6.html)
